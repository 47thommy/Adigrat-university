          <h6 className='padd'>AdU CET: A Brief Recap</h6>
          <p className='paragraph'>College of Engineering and Technology (CET) is the largest college
             in our University in line with the government policy. With about 
             8200 undergraduate regular, summer and extension students, and 
             more than 380 dedicated faculty members, our College is one of 
             the most vibrant in the northern Ethiopia. Moreover, we have 18 p
             ostgraduate students in the Computer Science and Information
              Technology programs.  The College of Engineering and Technology 
              currently offers 7 bachelor programs, namely,<span className=''> Architecture, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science & Information Technology, Construction Technology & Management Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The air condition of Adigrat is a perfect environment for learning. In addition, our close proximity to different industries is a great opportunity to our students. Our students are preferentially recruited by these industries, and many will enjoy internships with them as part of their educational experience. We also continue to expand programs to address global needs in different engineering disciplines; for example this year we have launched new postgraduate 
            programs in Computer Science and Information Technology</span>.</p>
